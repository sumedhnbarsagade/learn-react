</div>

<div id="unique-selling-point" class="tabcontentt">
    <h3>Unique Selling Point</h3>
    <h4>What makes iceDQ different?</h4>
    <p>The key differentiator is our in-memory rules engine(s). iceDQ validates data in the server memory allowing users to test a high volume of data efficiently. iceDQ also offers an engine based on Apache Spark, which enables users to scale testing of
        billions of rows on their Spark cluster.</p>

    <p>Customer support is also excellent. If you don’t believe it, then <a class="linkto gtm_internal_link" href="https://icedq.com/intro-call">sign up for a trial.</a></p>

    <h4>What is the difference between iceDQ vs. other ETL Testing Tools?</h4>
    <p>While there are many differences between iceDQ and other ETL Testing Tools, given below are a few that stand out the most.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>iceDQ evaluates data in memory; it does not load it into any database.</li>
        <li>It supports four different types of rules, Recon, Validation, Checksum, and Script.</li>
        <li>Users can use SQL + Apache Groovy to create advanced transformation checks.</li>
        <li>Users can write Script rules using Apache Groovy or Java.</li>
        <li>Governance/ Compliance Users for Governing or Monitoring Production systems</li>
        <li>It is a server-based platform and does not require any client installations</li>
        <li>An organization can create custom dashboards and reports using its enterprise reporting tool</li>
    </ol>
    <p>You can also read our article “<a class="linkto gtm_internal_link" href="https://icedq.com/data-quality-tools/iceDQ-platform-vs-data-quality-tools">iceDQ Platform vs Data Quality Tools</a>“</p>

    <h4>How does the script rule differ from other tools?</h4>
    <p>The Script Rule enables a user to automate the testing end to end. Users can write any custom Apache Groovy script or a Java class and execute it from iceDQ. Below are some of the real-world use cases of Script Rule:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Create tables and insert expected data for testing.</li>
        <li>Read a dynamic parameter from a database and pass it to a Rule.</li>
        <li>Take a backup of the table and compare it with the actual table post ETL.</li>
    </ol>

</div>

<div id="use-cases" class="tabcontentt">

    <h4>Can iceDQ compare a File with a database?</h4>
    <p>Yes, it can. iceDQ supports Flat Files, Excel, XML, JSON, Parquet, and other file formats.</p>

    <h4>Does it use a database to compare?</h4>
    <p>No, iceDQ does not use a database to compare or validate data. It has an in-memory rules engine purely built in Java and Spark.</p>

</div>

<div id="architecture" class="tabcontentt">
    <h3>Architecture</h3>
    <h4>Does iceDQ run on my desktop or server?</h4>
    <p>The software runs on a server where all the data processing happens. Users can access it through the web app; no client installations needed.</p>

    <h4>Does it use a database to compare?</h4>
    <p>No, iceDQ does not use a database to compare or validate data. It has an in-memory rules engine purely built in Java.</p>

    <p>Not at all. The engine pulls data into memory, in chunks, evaluates it, and keeps on doing that till the complete data set is validated.</p>

    <h4>How can I scale iceDQ?</h4>
    <p>There are multiple ways to scale iceDQ based on the requirement. Different options are available:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Adding more CPU will allow you to run more Rules in parallel.</li>
        <li>Using our HA Cluster will enable you to install the engine and app on multiple servers. This will make the app Highly available and increase the number of CPUs.</li>
        <li>Using <a class="linkto gtm_internal_link" href="https://icedq.com/high-throughput-edition">High Throughput Edition</a> will allow you to run a Rule on multiple cores, in turn, improving the
            performance of an individual Rule.
        </li>
        <li><a class="linkto gtm_internal_link" href="https://icedq.com/big-data-edition">Big Data Edition</a> will enable the user to scale the performance of an individual Rule based on the size of
            the cluster.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Do you expose any iceDQ API?</h4>
    <p>We do expose an API to execute Rules from any external tool for integration. Users can override connections and parameters on runtime using the API allowing them to reuse the Rules.</p>

    <h4>Can Rules be migrated to across instances of iceDQ?</h4>
    <p>Yes. Users can export an individual Rule, a batch of Rules, or a complete project into an export file. And then import it in any instance of iceDQ.</p>

    <p>Yes, we offer a Jumpstart program, Data Testing as a Service (DTaaS), Data Migration Testing Service, and also resources who are experts in Data Testing and iceDQ.</p>

    <h4>What does the Jumpstart program entail?</h4>
    <p>Along with the installation, configuration, and training, additional work of actually implementing test rules and mentoring for live projects.</p>

    <p>iceDQ resources will be collecting requirements and implementing audit rules and sharing experience with client resources. Eventually, the customer takes over the activities as they will have a complete grasp of the usage because of ongoing mentoring.</p>

    <h4>What is Data Testing as a Service?</h4>
    <p>Many organizations want to focus on their core activities and would like someone else manages their data testing and monitoring needs. In such cases, simply hiring an external resource does not work. Because the external resource is responsible for
        tasks but not the failure or success of the project, that risk is still with the customer.</p>

    <p>iceDQ specializes in data related testing and monitoring and offers “Data Testing as a Service” wherein the iceDQ team ultimately manages the resources and testing activities.</p>

    <p>The number of resources and their locations will be planned together with the client. Based on contract resource could be onsite, Nearshore/Offsite or Offshore depending on the options selected by the customer.</p>

    <p>Timeframe: Annual /Project</p>
